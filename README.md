# Outdoor Queens

This is a Django based (fictional!) e-commerce application which is the last of 5 required Code Institute portfolio projects.

Outdoor Queens offers a range of products, including tickets for hiking events, mud runs, and custom clothing & accessories. You can create an account to save your information, view order history, and purchase items. The site also features a contact form, FAQs, and an admin panel for managing the store's products.
