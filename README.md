# Outdoor Queens

This is a Django based (fictional!) e-commerce application which is the last of 5 required Code Institute portfolio projects.

Outdoor Queens offers a range of products, including tickets for hiking events, mud runs, and custom clothing & accessories. You can create an account to save your information, view order history, and purchase items. The site also features a contact form, FAQs, and an admin panel for managing the store's products.

## UI/UX
The design of the site is intentionally simple and minimalistic, reflecting the essence of hiking and mud runsâ€”where it's just you and nature. I wanted the user experience to be as straightforward and empowering as the adventures you embark on. The clean and uncluttered layout makes it easy to navigate, ensuring that users can focus on what matters most: their journey.

Additionally, the site features a subtle golden touch, symbolizing the sense of achievement and pride that comes with completing an event. Just like a successful hike or mud run, when you make it through, you look back and feel like a queen for what you've accomplished. This golden accent adds a feeling of triumph and celebration to every interaction.

## Agile
This project follows Agile principles to ensure a flexible, iterative approach to development. I break down tasks into manageable pieces, allowing for quick adjustments and continuous improvements based on feedback. The iterative nature of Agile helps keep the development process efficient and adaptable to changes.

To visualize and track progress, I use a Kanban board. The board provides a clear view of tasks at various stages, helping me stay organized and focused. Tasks are divided into columns such as:

To Do: Tasks that need to be worked on.
In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
Done: Tasks that are completed and finalized.
